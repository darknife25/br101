					Hey there. If you're here, that means you have an issue to report! Well, you're in the right place. Before we get started, though, let's look at one important thing (click on the text below to see why it's important):<br><br>
					<div id="why3" class="why">Are you using Optifine?</div>
					<div id="why-expl3" class="why-expl">
						Optifine, as implied by it's function, changes the basic way things are drawn on the screen. Some mods depend on complex rendering sequences to get the desired visual effect for their blocks/items/entities/whatever. If something looks out of place with optifine installed, try it without optifine and see if it looks right, and if it does, the issue has to do with the interaction between the mod and optifine.<br><br>
						As Optifine is a closed source mod, workarounds are not possible without technically violating the license. That's the main reason why most mods do not support optifine.
					</div><br><hr><br>
					After you've checked this out and are confident the issue is not caused by the issue stated above, by all means, carry on!
				</div>
				<div id="inst1" class="instructions">
					Start by briefly describing what the issue is, try to be as concise as possible. Make sure you highlight details, any cross mod interactions should be explained, the more you leave out, the harder it is to find the issue and fix it.<br><br>
					Please ensure you use the correct format, this will help staff members to diagnose the problem sooner.<br><br>
					<div class="examples">Format:</div>
					<div class="example-box">
						<b>In-Game Name:<br><br>
						<b>Description of the Crash:<br><br>
						<b>What Type of Computer (Operating System):<br><br>
						<b>Java Version:<br><br>
						<b>Can you run Singleplayer? (Yes/No):<br><br>
						<b>Can you run Vannila MC? (Yes/No):<br><br>
						<b>Anything you have Tried::
					</div>
					If you're struggling to put an explanation of the issue in words, take a screenshot or a video. Minecraft has screenshots built in with the F2 key. After you took a screenshot, upload it to <a href="http://imgur.com/">imgur</a> or any other image hosting website.<br><br>
					<div class="examples">Examples:</div>
					<div class="example-box">
						<b>Bad: </b><i>i tried to create the blocky thingymajig and my game crashed help please</i><br><br>
						<b>Good: </b><i>I was trying to create the Blocky Thingymajig, I gathered all the crafting components, when I pulled the item out of a Super Crafting Table from the SuperCrafting mod, my game crashed.</i>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="inst2" class="instructions">
					Make sure to include the FML log, regardless of your game having crashed or not. The log contains all sorts of important information such as which mods are loaded, alongside which versions. Make sure to check out the following points (click on them for more info):<br><br>
					<div id="why4" class="why">How do I get the log?</div>
					<div id="why-expl4" class="why-expl">
						Start off by going to your .minecraft folder, as you normally do to install a mod. You should have a "logs" folder. Inside it, look for "fml-client-1.log", open it with Notepad or your text editor of choice (Notepad++ is pretty good!) and there you go, there's the log.
					</div>
					<div id="why5" class="why">Where do I put the log?</div>
					<div id="why-expl5" class="why-expl">
						Absolutely <b>never</b> paste the log next to the report, doing so causes an incredible amount of clutter and is really hard to look at. Instead of that, put the log in a paste hosting website and attach a link to it, here's a few examples:<br><br>
						<a href="http://pastebin.com/">pastebin</a> <a href="http://hastebin.com/">hastebin</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> <a href="http://www.pastie.org/">pastie</a> <a href="http://puush.me/">puush</a>
					</div><br><br>
					<div class="examples">Examples:</div>
					<div class="example-box">
						<b>Bad: </b><i>crash log: (crash log here)</i><br><br>
						<b>Good: </b><i>FML Log: <a href="http://puu.sh/8BDKc.log">http://puu.sh/8BDKc.log</a></i>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div id="inst3" class="instructions">
					Review your issue. Make sure it's well structured, try to look at it from the point of view from someone who is trying to follow the steps you give them to reproduce what happened.<br><br>If a staff member can't read what you did and reproduce the issue themselves, more likely than not, you left a step out. Try to follow it yourself and see if you can have it happen again with the information you gave only.<br><br>
					<div class="examples">Example:</div>
					<div class="example-box">
						My game crashes when I try to create a Blocky Thingymajig from your mod using a Super Crafting Table from the SuperCrafting mod. I can get it to happen every time by simply placing the materials in the table and pulling the Blocky Thingymajig out (both via shift-click and just a normal click).<br><br>
						This does not happen with any other item from any other mod (at least from the ones I've tried). The crafting works fine with a normal vanilla Crafting Table.
